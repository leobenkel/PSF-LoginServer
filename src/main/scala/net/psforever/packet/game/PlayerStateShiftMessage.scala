/**
  * Instructs an avatar to be stood, to look, and to move, in a certain way.<br>
  * <br>
  * The position defines a coordinate location in the avatar's current zone to which the avatar is immediately moved
  * This movement is instantaneous and has no associated animation.
  * If velocity is defined, the avatar is provided an "external force" that "pushes" the avatar in a given direction.
  * This external force is not accumulative.
  * Also, the external force is only applied once the avatar is set to the provided position.<br>
  * <br>
  * The angle defines the center of a range of angles that count as "in front of the avatar."
  * Specifically, this range is the upper body's turn limit.
  * A stationary player may look left and right, rotating their upper body only, until they hit a certain angle.
  * Normally, the player's whole body will then turn to accommodate turning further than this angle.
  * This packet marks that limit as a hard limit for rotation and will reset the player's model and camera if necessary.
  * While it is in effect, the player will not turn their whole body once they can no longer turn their upper body.
  * @param unk na
  * @param pos the position to move the character to in the world environment
  * @param viewYawLim the center of the range of upper body angles, the player's actual yaw;
  *                   if this value is beyond its angular limit values,
  *                   the model will attempt to snap to what it considers the closest upper body turning limit angle;
  *                   the actual range is approximately `viewYawLimit +/- 61.8215`;
  * @param vel if defined, the velocity to apply to to the character at the given position
  * @see `PlayerStateMessageUpstream.facingYawUpper`
  * @see `PlayerStateMessage.facingYawUpper`
